Nowadays,graduates are more and more difficult to find jobs.Why this
phenomenon happened.
In my opinions,on the one hand,with the education reform began,more and
more students have access to university.Thus the number of graduates is
bigger than the number of positions.On the other hand,most graduates tend
to stay in large cities without pleasant jobs rather than go to small cities.
To ease the burden of getting jobs,I think both governments and ourselves
should take measures.At first,we should transform our attitudes towards
employment,we should not just focus our eyes on big cities,we can go to the
small city or country for jobs.Second,government should create more
employment opportunities for graduates.Only we can do that,the burden of
employment will decrease.
