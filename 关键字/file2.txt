Nowadays,graduates are more and more difficult to find jobs.Why this
phenomenon happened.
In my opinions,on the one hand,with the education reform began,more and
more students have access to university.Thus the number of graduates is
bigger than the number of positions.On the other hand,most graduates tend
to stay in large cities without pleasant jobs rather than go to small cities.
